# About project

The main objective of my project was to learn Typescript and how to work with the back-end in Next.js. To achieve this, I attempted to replicate the Airbnb website. In this project, I allowed anyone to create a user account, create a listing, set favorites listings, search using filters : country/number of guests/dates, create reservations, remove reservations, if you are owner of one property you can remove specific reservations, listing reservations, trips screen, properties screen and many more. 

# Features
Among the main features are:

- Authentication system
- Google and Github OAuth
- Prisma ORM with MongoDB
- Responsive Layout
- Listing creation
- Fetching listings with server components (Listing card component, direct server action)
- Favoriting functionality
- Individual Listing View
- Listing reservation component
- Reservation functionality (routes, logic)
- Trips screen (Loading trips with server component)
- Reservations screen (Loading guest reservations with server component)
- Favorites screen (Loading favorites with server component)
- Properties screen (Loading your listings with server component)
